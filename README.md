## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]


In this day in age, people are getting more and more connected by the minute. This used to mean just phones, but devices and form factors continue to evolve over time. I'm willing to bet that if you walk down the street in your town, there's a good chance that you will see a number of people with smart watches. And more than just smart watches, you will see Apple Watches. Are you taking advantage of this opportunity? If not, why not? 

In this course, Derek will show you how to create a simple Apple Watch app using WatchKit using some very basic skills and technologies. Follow along and you'll learn how to create a watchOS project, and how to design an app with the Interface Builder. You'll also learn how to structure an app with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and how to code your app logic using the concepts of states and transitions. Along the way you'll learn how to use some really useful UI components and even how to integrate haptic feedback in your app.
